This is a reasonable estimate of the population median, but we might not be sure about how close we are the actual population median. In order to figure out our margin of error of this estimate, we can use bootstrap samples. A bootstrap sample is a random sample from the original data of the same size with replacement. If there were 100 people in the sample originally, I would randomly sample 100 observations from the dataset, and since it is with replacement, some rows will be sampled more than once and some not at all in a particular bootstrap sample (at least 1,000). Typically, you want to collect many bootstrap samples to generate an empirical sampling distribution. The idea is that the original sample resembles the population. If this is true, then you can use the original sample as the sampling frame, draw the 1,000+ bootstrap samples with replacement, and compute a statistic of interest in each resample (here, the median). This will leave you with 1,000+ medians that form the empirical sampling distribution of the median. (This approximates what we may have observed had we actually conducted 1,000+ studies of the same size and drawn data from the same population, computing the median in each.) We can use this empirical sampling distribution to construct confidence intervals for inference (e.g., about whether the population median is different from zero). You can create a bootstrap confidence interval a number of ways, but the most popular way is to sort the distribution of estimates and take, if it's a 95% confidence interval, the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values and observing whether zero is between the values. If not, then you would reject the null hypothesis. \n",
