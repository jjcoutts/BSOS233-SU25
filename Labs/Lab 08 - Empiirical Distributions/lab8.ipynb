    "\n",
    "Rather than getting data on every player, imagine that we had gotten data on only a smaller subset of the players. For 492 players, it's not so unreasonable to expect to see all the data, but usually we aren't so lucky. The population of interest is too big or unreachable to collect observations from everyone. Instead, we often make statistical inferences about a large underlying population using a smaller sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *statistical inference* is a statement about some parameter of the underlying population, such as \"the average salary of NBA players in 2014 was $3\". You may have heard the word \"inference\" used in other contexts (e.g., logical/deductive inferences). It's important to keep in mind that statistical inferences, unlike, say, logical inferences, can be wrong. In fact, our methods even have built-in amounts of error, such as a Type I error rate (that we set!).\n",
    "\n",
    "A general strategy for inference using samples is to estimate parameters of the population by computing the same statistics on a sample. This strategy sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't. The degree to which it gives us useful answers depends on several factorsâ€”some of which we'll cover today.\n",

When we go to use this function, we will set data equal to our table name and put *Age* and *Salary* as the values for the other two arguments. It uses bin widths of 1 year for `Age` and $1,000,000 for `Salary`."
