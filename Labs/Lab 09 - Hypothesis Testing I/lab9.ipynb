    "### Review of Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from a prior statistics class (or our class): When it comes to hypothesis testing, there are two hypotheses pertinent to our investigation...the **null** and **alternative** hypotheses, denoted H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>, respectively. The null hypothesis is a statement of the default position, or the idea that nothing is happening. If we were studying the effects of a weight-loss intervention by conducting an experiment, a null hypothesis might be, H<sub>0</sub>: There will be no difference in weight between the treatment and non-treatment groups (or, alternatively, there will be no effect of the weight-loss intervention on weight loss). If we were conducting a correlational study on smoking and lung cancer, the null hypothesis may be H<sub>0</sub>: There will be no correlation between the number of cigarettes one smokes and lung cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis, however, is the compliment (i.e., opposite) of the null hypothesis. This statement is making a design-specific prediction about the nature of the relationship between the predictor and outcome. In the example above, the alternative hypotheses would be H<sub>1</sub>: There will be a difference in weight between the treatment and non-treatment groups and H<sub>1</sub>: There will be a correlation between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Review of One- and Two-Tailed Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two** types of hypotheses: **one-tailed** and **two-tailed**. One-tailed hypotheses make a prediction about a specific size or in a specific direction. For example, H<sub>0</sub>: There will be a *negative or no* correlation between smoking and lung cancer vs. H<sub>1</sub>: There will be a *positive* correlation between smoking and lung cancer. A two-tailed hypothesis is agnositic about the nature and direction of the relationship, which is largely what our examples above were. e.g., H<sub>0</sub>: There will be no relationship between smoking and lung cancer vs. H<sub>1</sub>: There will be a relationship between smoking and lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is important because in statistics, we test against the null hypothesis. That means that based on the data we collect and analyses we conduct, we either *reject* or *fail-to-reject* the null hypothesis. We never *confirm* it. However, if we can *reject* the idea that nothing is happening, we can deduct or infer that something is happening. If we're making a two-tailed hypothesis, we're okay with that something being positive or negative, or being above or below a specific value. However, if we make a one-tailed prediction, then we are excluding effects in a particular direction in favor of our chosen one. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will be essential for you in research, modeling, and this class to become adept at **forming**,**evaluating**, and **interpreting** null/alternative hypotheses and the results of an analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Therapeutic Touch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Therapeutic Touch (TT) is the idea that everyone can feel the Human Energy Field (HEF) around individuals. Certain practictioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals. Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy\". \n",
    "\n",
    "TT was a popular technique used throughout the 20th century that was toted to be a great way to bring balance to a person's health. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Emily Rosa\n",
    "\n",
    "[Emily Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Rosa) was a 4th grade student who had wide exposure to the world of TT due to her parents. Her parents were both medical practitioners and skeptics of the idea of TT. \n",
    "\n",
    "For her 4th grade science fair project, Emily decided to test whether or not TT practitioners could truly interact with a person's HEF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emily's Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's experiment was clean, simple, and effective. Due to her parents' occupations in the medical field, she had wide access to people who claimed to be TT practitioners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to correctly answer which hand Emily put out. Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether the treatment has an effect, *not* whether the treatment actually works. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now begin to formulate this experiment in terms of the terminology we learned in this course. "
