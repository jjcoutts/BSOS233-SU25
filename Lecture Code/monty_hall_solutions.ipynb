    "Below are two answers to the Monty Hall Problem. One does the looping inside the function while the other iterates a function that plays a single game many times. Both functions produce identical results, which show that the probability of winning is tied to whether you switch. You win twice as often when you switch because if you pick the right door and stay you win (1/3 chance), but if you pick the wrong door (2/3 chance) and switch, you win. This is a probability puzzle that confuses many people who hear it!"
